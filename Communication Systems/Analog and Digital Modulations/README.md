# Problem Statement 1
Generate an AM output for the given modulating signal and carrier wave 
Carrier frequency: Sine wave with A = 5; f = 4500Hz; Phi = 0
Modulating signal: Sine wave with A = 2.5; f = 100Hz; Phi = 0

Show all the signals in the time domain.
Build the Demodulation system and demonstrate demodulated output.

# Problem Statement 2
Write a MATLAB script to generate a binary PSK signal for a random base band data of 16 bits. 

Assume the carrier frequency fc as 1000Hz
