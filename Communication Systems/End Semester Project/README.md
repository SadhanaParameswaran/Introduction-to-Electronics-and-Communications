## Abstract:

The communication system is a system which describes the information exchange between two points. The process of transmission and reception of information is called communication. The major elements of communication are the Transmitter of information, Channel or medium of communication and the Receiver of information.
In our project we show the MATLAB simulation of transmitter and receiver for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) & Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) modulation and apply these modulation techniques with Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to compare which is the better method by analyzing the Bit error rate (BER) vs Signal to noise ratio (SNR) graphs for each of the techniques.
After visual analysis of the BER vs SNR graph, we conclude that QPSK is the better technique as it has a lower bit error rate compared to QAM for a given SNR value

## Conclusion:

It is observed that for Signal to Noise Ratio, the BER for QAM is higher than QPSK
For example, when SNR = ‘4’
For QAM, in 100 bits, 5 bits have a probability of error
For QPSK, in 100 bits, 1 bit has a probability of error
Observing the graph, we deduce that OFDM using QPSK's theoretical and simulated points are closer than that of QAM
Hence, the performance of QPSK is better than 16 QAM because the BER values with respect to the Average received SNR (in dB) in case of QPSK are lower than the values obtained in the case of 16 QAM.
